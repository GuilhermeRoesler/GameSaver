# 🎮 GameSaver - Manage Your Game Saves with Ease

## 📌 About the Project

**GameSaver** is a powerful tool for managing saves from all detected games on your computer. It allows you to:

- ✅ **Automatically back up** all detected game saves.
- ✅ **Quickly restore** saves to prevent progress loss.
- ✅ **User-friendly** configuration through JSON files.
- ✅ **Synchronize** a custom save folder with respective games.
- ✅ **Support multiple games**, ensuring compatibility across various platforms.

### 🕹️ Example Use Case

Imagine you are playing multiple local games, and you want to ensure your progress is backed up in case of a system crash. With **GameSaver**, you can:

- Run a **single command** to collect and back up all your saves.
- Easily restore your saves whenever needed.
- Share your progress across multiple devices by syncing your save files.

## 🚀 How It Works?

GameSaver scans your computer for game saves and organizes them efficiently. It can also distribute previously stored saves to the respective game directories, ensuring you always have your progress safe and available. You can manually add any path and it will save the corresponding folder.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Settings (settings.json)

The application uses a settings file that contains:

- `destination_location`: Where save backups will be stored
- `mode`: Operation mode (`collect` or `spread`)

### Games Database (games.json)

Add your games in the following format:

```json
{
    "game": "Game Name",
    "path": "\\AppData\\Roaming\\YourGame",
    "last_save": ""
}
```

## 💾 Creating the Executable

If you don’t want to download the **pre-built executable** available in the **Releases** section on [GitHub](https://github.com/GuilhermeRoesler/GameSaver/releases), you can create your own using Python's `pyinstaller` library. To do so, first install it:

```sh
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then, open the project folder and **run**:

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "games_database.json;." .\main.py
```

This will generate some folders. Open the `dist` folder, and you should find the **ready-to-use executable**. If everything is set up correctly, your executable should run without issues! 🎉

## ❗ Notes & FAQ

### ❓ What if my game is not detected?

Some games store save files in custom locations. You may need to manually add them to `games_database.json`.

### ❓ Can I sync my saves between multiple devices?

Yes! You can store your backed-up saves in a cloud service like Google Drive or OneDrive and restore them on another device.

### ❓ Does GameSaver support online games?

GameSaver primarily works with local saves. Online-only games that store progress in the cloud may not be compatible.
